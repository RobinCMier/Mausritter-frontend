/*TO DO
concept: 
user gets here thru buttonlink on homepage
page is a form, that looks similar to the charactersheet but everything is an input field and there's a submit button
on submit, redirect to homepage, and homepage should rerender to show new chaarcter sheet.

In dispatch action, there should be a userId!!!
THIS IS TEMP, should get the token to work actually, and then this would not be needed.
